# androidapp
the android app i created for my uni module using the IGDB API and shared prefrences for local storage.

Due to time constraints the app was not finished but received a 2:1  

the spec for the coursewok was to create an app that used an API, framework and data persistance. the app used the IGDB API, the GSON framework for JSON handling and shared prefrences for the data persistance. it allowed users to search for a game read the description for the game and save it. due to the time constraints the app had limited functionality
